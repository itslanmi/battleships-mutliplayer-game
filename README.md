## 🎮 How the Game Works
Battleship is a **turn-based strategy game** where two players take turns firing at each other’s fleet. The first to **sink all enemy ships** wins the battle! 💥

### 🛠️ Game Mechanics
- You get **two grids**: one for your fleet and one for attacking the enemy. 📍
- Place your ships **manually** or let the game **randomly position them**. 🚢📌
- Click on the enemy grid to fire your shots! 🎯
- If you hit a ship, the spot will be **marked**! If you miss, it’ll be **indicated** too. ❌✅
- Keep firing until one fleet is **completely destroyed**! 🔥

## 📜 Game Rules
### 📏 Battlefield Setup
✅ The board is a **10x10 grid** (default size).  
✅ Ships come in different sizes and shapes (e.g., 1x1, 1x2, 1x3).  
✅ Ships **can’t overlap**.  

### 🎯 Turn-Based Combat
1️⃣ Players take turns clicking a tile on the enemy grid.  
2️⃣ A **hit** is marked, and the ship takes damage.  
3️⃣ A **miss** is also marked, so you know where not to aim again.  
4️⃣ The game continues until **one player loses all their ships**. 🚢💀
